# method_overriding
This project demonstrates Method Overriding in Java, a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The Animal class has a sound() method, which is overridden by the Dog and Cat subclasses to provide specific behavior. The main method highlights polymorphism by invoking the overridden methods on subclass objects.
